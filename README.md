# Datarium
An Enterprise cloud solution that reimagines data privacy and data control with regards to social media websites

# Abstract

Data privacy and control are critical considerations in the digital era, particularly within the European Union, where stringent regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demand user-centric data governance. This paper proposes a novel enterprise cloud solution that leverages AWS services to establish a central data repository under government control. Users retain ownership of their content, contributing it directly to the repository, while private entities such as social media platforms access this data through an event-driven push architecture.

The proposed system ensures compliance with privacy regulations by centralizing data governance, providing transparency, and fostering trust between stakeholders. By employing serverless computing, scalable storage, and secure data transfer mechanisms, this architecture supports real-time data exchange while safeguarding user rights. The research highlights the technical implementation of this model, its implications for data privacy and control, and its potential to redefine the relationship between users, governments, and private organizations. This work offers a robust foundation for future applications in secure and ethical data-driven ecosystems.
